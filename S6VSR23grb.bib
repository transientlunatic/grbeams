  abstract={Using a collapsar progenitor model of MacFadyen \& Woosley, we have simulated the propagation of an axisymmetric jet through a collapsing rotating massive star with the GENESIS multidimensional relativistic hydrodynamic code. The jet forms as a consequence of an assumed (constant or variable) energy deposition in the range of 1050-1051 ergs s-1 within a 30deg cone around the rotation axis. The jet flow is strongly beamed (approximately less than a few degrees), spatially inhomogeneous, and time dependent. The jet reaches the surface of the stellar progenitor (R* = 2.98 x 1010 cm) intact. At breakout, the maximum Lorentz factor of the jet flow is 33. After breakout, the jet accelerates into the circumstellar medium, whose density is assumed to decrease exponentially and then become constant, rext = 10-5 g cm-3. Outside the star, the flow begins to expand laterally also (v \~{} c), but the beam remains very well collimated. At a distance of 2.54 R*, where the simulation ends, the Lorentz factor has increased to 44.}

  abstract={Precursor emission has been observed in a nonnegligible fraction of gamma-ray bursts. The time gap between the precursor and the main burst extends in some cases up to hundreds of seconds. Both the origins of the precursor and the large value of the time gap are controversial. Here we investigate the maximum possible time gaps arising from the jet propagation inside the progenitor star in models which assume that the precursor is produced by the jet bow shock or the cocoon breaking out of the progenitor. Because of the pressure drop ahead of the jet head after it reaches the stellar surface, a rarefaction wave propagates back into the jet at the sound speed, which reaccelerates the jet to a relativistic velocity and therefore limits the gap period to within about 10 s. This scenario therefore cannot explain gaps which are hundreds of seconds long. Instead, we ascribe such long time gaps to the behavior of the central engine and suggest a fallback collapsar scenario for these bursts. In this scenario, the precursor is produced by a weak jet formed during the initial core collapse, possibly related to MHD processes associated with a short-lived proto-neutron star, while the main burst is produced by a stronger jet fed by fallback accretion onto the black hole resulting from the collapse of the neutron star. We find that the initial weak jet can break out of the progenitor in a time less than 10 s (a typical precursor duration) provided that it has a moderately high relativistic Lorentz factor G [?] 10.}

We find that the interaction of the relativistic material with the progenitor star has influences well beyond the stellar surface. Tangential collimation shocks are observed throughout the jet evolution, out to about 100 stellar radii, which is the whole range of our simulation. We find that the jet is internally hot at the photospheric radius and we compute the photospheric emission. The photosphere is a very efficient radiator, capable of converting more than half of the total energy of the jet into radiation. We show that bright photospheres are a common feature of jets born inside massive progenitor stars and that this effect can explain the high radiative efficiency observed in long-duration bursts.}

  abstract={We examine the propagation of two-dimensional relativistic jets through the stellar progenitor in the collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Each jet is parameterized by a radius where it is introduced and by its initial Lorentz factor, opening angle, power, and internal energy. In agreement with previous studies, we find that relativistic jets are collimated by their passage through the stellar mantle. Starting with an initial half-angle of up to 20deg, they emerge with half-angles that, though variable with time, are around 5deg. Interaction of these jets with the star and their own cocoons also causes mixing that sporadically decelerates the flow. We speculate that this mixing instability is chiefly responsible for the variable Lorentz factor needed in the internal shock model and for the complex light curves seen in many GRBs. In all cases studied, the jet is shocked deep inside the star following a brief period of adiabatic expansion. This shock converts most of the jet's kinetic energy into internal energy, so even initially "cold" jets become hot after going a short distance. The jet that finally emerges from the star thus has a moderate Lorentz factor, modulated by mixing, and a very large internal energy. In a second series of calculations, we follow the escape of that sort of jet. Conversion of the remaining internal energy gives terminal Lorentz factors along the axis of approximately 150 for the initial conditions chosen. Because of the large ratio of internal to kinetic energy in both the jet ([?]80\%) and its cocoon, the opening angle of the final jet is significantly greater than at breakout. A small amount of material emerges at large angles, but with a Lorentz factor still sufficiently large to make a weak GRB. This leads us to propose a "unified model" in which a variety of high-energy transients, ranging from X-ray flashes to "classic" GRBs, may be seen depending on the angle at which a standard collapsar is observed. We also speculate that the breakout of a relativistic jet and its collision with the stellar wind will produce a brief transient with properties similar to the class of "short-hard" GRBs. Implications of our calculations for GRB light curves, the luminosity-variability relation, and the GRB-supernova association are also discussed.}

This type of analysis makes use of GRB time and position information from gamma-ray satellite detectors to trigger the GWB search, and the GWB detection rates possible for such an analysis thus strongly depend on the GRB detection efficiencies of the satellite detectors. Using local GRB rate densities inferred from observations which are found in the science literature, we calculate estimates of the GWB detection rates for different configurations of the LIGO-Virgo network for this type of analysis.}

We also show that physically reasonable and numerically convergent results obtained at low resolution suffer however from large truncation errors and hence are of little physical use. We summarize our findings in an 'error budget', which includes the different sources of possible inaccuracies we have investigated and provides a first quantitative assessment of the precision in the modelling of compact fluid binaries.}

GRB 060218 to a low-metallicity dwarf starburst galaxy at z = 0.03345
+- 0.00006. In addition to making it the second nearest gamma-ray
burst known, optical spectroscopy reveals the earliest detection of
weak, supernova-like Si II near 5720 A (\~{}0.1c), starting 1.95 days
after the burst trigger. UBVRI photometry obtained between 1 and 26
days postburst confirms the early rise of supernova light, and
suggests a short time delay between the gamma-ray burst and the onset
of SN 2006aj if the early appearance of a soft component in the X-ray
spectrum is understood as a "shock breakout." Together, these results
verify the long-hypothesized origin of soft gamma-ray bursts in the
deaths of massive stars.}

  abstract={We present our latest results of simulation for merger of black hole (BH)-neutron star (NS) binaries in full general relativity which is performed preparing a quasicircular state as the initial condition. The BH is modelled by a moving puncture with no spin and the NS by the G-law equation of state with G = 2 and a corotating velocity field as a first step. The mass of the BH is chosen to be [?]3.2M[?] or 4.0M[?], and the rest mass of the NS [?]1.4M[?] with a relatively large radius of the NS [?]13-14 km. The NS is tidally disrupted near the innermost stable orbit, but [?]80-90\% of the material is swallowed into the BH and the resulting disc mass is not very large as [?]0.3M[?] even for a small BH mass [?]3.2M[?]. The result indicates that the system composed of BH and a massive disc of [?]M[?] is not formed from nonspinning BH-NS binaries irrespective of the BH mass, although a disc of mass [?]0.1M[?] is a possible outcome for this relatively small BH mass range as [?]3-4M[?]. Our results indicate that the merger of low-mass BH and NS may form a central engine of short-gamma-ray bursts.}

GRB 050915a was detected by the Swift satellite in 2005, when the Virgo detector was engaged in one of its science runs, namely the C7 run, during which the best sensitivity attained in 2005 was exhibited. This offered the opportunity for the first coincident analysis between a gamma-ray burst and the Virgo gravitational wave detector. Here we give an overview of this ongoing analysis, which at the end will play the role of a prototype, crucial in defining a methodology for gamma-ray burst triggered searches with Virgo. The final results of our analysis will also allow us to evaluate up to which level Virgo will be able to constrain the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal from a typical long gamma-ray burst.}

  abstract={In the framework of the expected association between gamma-ray bursts and gravitational waves, we present results of an analysis aimed to search for a burst of gravitational waves in coincidence with gamma-ray burst 050915a. This was a long duration gamma-ray burst detected by Swift during September 2005, when the Virgo gravitational wave detector was engaged in a commissioning run during which the best sensitivity attained in 2005 was exhibited. This offered the opportunity for Virgo's first search for a gravitational wave signal in coincidence with a gamma-ray burst. The result of our study is a set of strain amplitude upper limits, based on the loudest event approach, for different but quite general types of burst signal waveforms. The best upper limit strain amplitudes we obtain are h_{rss}={\\cal O}(10\^{}{-20}) Hz[?]1/2 around [?]200-1500 Hz. These upper limits allow us to evaluate the level up to which Virgo, when reaching nominal sensitivity, will be able to constrain the gravitational wave output associated with a long burst. Moreover, the analysis presented here plays the role of a prototype, crucial in defining a methodology for gamma-ray burst triggered searches with Virgo and opening the way for future joint analyses with LIGO.}
